In output stationary architecture, the output data remains stationary in the Processing Elements(PEs) while the input data and weights move.</p> <p>In this post, I’ll use Python to implement three approaches of output stationary data-flow - one from the textbook, and other two came up by myself. We simulate PEs using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Process</code> class from the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">multiprocessing</code> library. Dataflows are managed via <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Queue</code>, and outputs are stored in <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Array</code>.</p> <p>(Still editing…)</p> </body></html>
