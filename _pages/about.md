I'm currently pursuing my Master's degree in [Electrical Engineering](https://viterbigradadmission.usc.edu/programs/masters/msprograms/electrical-computer-engineering/ms-electrical-engineering/) 
at [University of Southern California](https://www.usc.edu).
I earned my Bachelor's degree from [Fudan University](https://www.fudan.edu.cn/en/), graduating with high honors (Summa Cum Laude) and receiving the Chinese National Scholarship.
Now I'm on the lookout for exciting opportunities in the field of software engineering.
