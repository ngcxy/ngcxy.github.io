This is a personal-use post for hosting a full-stack website for public access. 
Everytime I wanted to deploy a new website, I had to go through several tutorials and stuck in the same problems over and over again.
Therefore, I decide to record the whole process based on my previous experience in this post, so that I can deploy my website smoother in the future.

# Backend

The backend will be hosted on AWS EC2.
First, check if your AWS account still has enough free tier usage (i.e., it's in the first 12 month). 
If you can afford, never mind. Otherwise, create a new account.

### Security Group

Two SG should be created: one for ssh connection, one for internet access

ssh-sg: 
- inbound:  SSH-TCP-22-Custom-0.0.0.0/0
- outbound: All traffic-All-All-Custom-0.0.0.0/0

internet-sg:
- inbound: Custom TCP-TCP-4000-Custom-0.0.0.0/0, HTTP-TCP-80-Custom-0.0.0.0/0, HTTPS-TCP-443-Custom-0.0.0.0/0
- outbound: All traffic-All-All-Custom-0.0.0.0/0

### EC2 instance

Linux, t2.micro, select a key pair, put 2 SGs in, launch.

After the instance is successfully launched, connect it via SSH. (in aws/local terminal)

### Initialize machine

Run the following code to update the environment:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install nodejs -y
sudo apt install npm -y
sudo npm install --global yarn
sudo npm i ts-node --g
sudo snap install docker
sudo docker version     # check if success
```

### Repository download

Generate an SSH Key for GitHub access:

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

Then paste the public key into GitHub Settings.

Select a location to clone the GitHub repository. Remember to check some configuration such as the base url and port.

**Direct to that folder.**

Add a .env file if your app uses environment variables. Then go into the file and paste in your environment variables.

```bash
touch .env
sudo nano .env
```

### First Test

Run the application. The terminal should show success message.
We cannot access through the ip yet, since the port isn't accessible right now.

```bash
npm install
node server.js
```

If you encounter this problem:

```text
            session: options?.session,
                             ^
SyntaxError: Unexpected token '.'
```

Just update your Node.js:

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.1/install.sh | bash

export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"  # This loads nvm
[ -s "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/bash_completion"  # This loads nvm bash_completion

nvm ls-remote
nvm install <version>
nvm use <version>
```

### Add NGINX

NGINX: a highly popular open-source web server, reverse proxy server, load balancer, and HTTP cache.

Go to root directory, install NGINX, and go to that directory.

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/coderaidershaun/nginx-with-docker.git
cd nginx-with-docker
sudo nano nginx.conf # modify the config file
```

Modify the conf file following the comment, change all the "frontend" part to "backend". 
Then build the docker image(might take some time):

*tips for nano: save&exit is Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X*

```bash
sudo docker build -t nginx-with-docker . --no-cache
```

### Permanently running service

We need to keep the NGINX and backend running all the time even after system reboot.

For NGINX:

```bash
cd ~
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/reverseproxy.service
```

Paste this in the service file:

```text
[Unit]
Description=Reverseproxy Service
After=network.target
Wants=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=sudo docker run -p 80:80 nginx-with-docker

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable reverseproxy
sudo systemctl start reverseproxy
sudo systemctl status reverseproxy
```

The status should show "active (running)" in green.

Other useful code for debug:
```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl stop reverseproxy
sudo journalctl -fu reverseproxy.service
```

---

For Backend:

```bash
cd ~
sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/backend.service
```
You should find the path of your new version of node.js using "whereis node". Then remember to change the path in below.

Paste this in the service file:

```text
[Unit]
Description=Backend Service
After=network.target
Wants=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
Restart=always
RestartSec=5
ExecStart=/home/ubuntu/.nvm/versions/node/v20.11.1/bin/node /home/ubuntu/movipendent/backend/server.js

[Install]
WantedBy=default.target
```

Then start the service:

```bash
sudo systemctl enable backend
sudo systemctl start backend
sudo systemctl status backend
```

### Second test

Now access your **endpoint** through HTTP, you should see your server working.


# Frontend

Somehow my EC2 t2.micro always fail when I run frontend and backend simultaneously, so I turn to Vercel to host my frontend.

The steps on Vercel are quite straight-forward, just connect to your gitHub repository and modify the backend url in config file. 
The most critical issue is to establish a connection between Vercel as HTTPS to EC2 instance as HTTP.

# API Gateway
